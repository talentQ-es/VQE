	abstract = {Quantum simulation of chemical systems is one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computers. The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},

	abstract = {The atomic nucleus is a quantum many-body system whose constituent nucleons (protons and neutrons) are subject to complex nucleon-nucleon interactions that include spin- and isospin-dependent components. For stable nuclei, several decades ago, emerging seemingly regular patterns in some observables could already be described successfully within a shell-model picture that results in particularly stable nuclei at certain magic fillings of the shells with protons and/or neutrons: N, Z=8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126. However, in short-lived, so-called exotic nuclei or rare isotopes, characterized by a large N/Z asymmetry and located far from the valley of β stability on the nuclear chart, these magic numbers, viewed through observables, were shown to change. These changes in the regime of exotic nuclei offer an unprecedented view at the roles of the various components of the nuclear force when theoretical descriptions are confronted with experimental data on exotic nuclei where certain effects are enhanced. This article reviews the driving forces behind shell evolution from a theoretical point of view and connects this to experimental signatures.},

	abstract = {Atomic nuclei are important laboratories for exploring and testing new insights into the universe, such as experiments to directly detect dark matter or explore properties of neutrinos. The targets of interest are often heavy, complex nuclei that challenge our ability to reliably model them (as well as quantify the uncertainty of those models) with classical computers. Hence there is great interest in applying quantum computation to nuclear structure for these applications. As an early step in this direction, especially with regards to the uncertainties in the relevant quantum calculations, we develop circuits to implement variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms for the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, which is often used in the nuclear physics community as a testbed for many-body methods. We present quantum circuits for VQE for two and three particles and discuss the construction of circuits for more particles. Implementing the VQE for a two-particle system on the IBM Quantum Experience, we identify initialization and two-qubit gates as the largest sources of error. We find that error mitigation procedures reduce the errors in the results significantly, but additional quantum hardware improvements are needed for quantum calculations to be sufficiently accurate to be competitive with the best current classical methods.},

We present a shell-model quantum circuit design strategy to find nuclear ground states that circumvents this limitation by exploiting an adaptive variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. Our circuit implementation is in excellent agreement with classical shell-model simulations for a dozen of light and medium-mass nuclei, including neon and calcium isotopes. We quantify the circuit depth, width and number of gates to encode realistic shell-model wavefunctions. Our strategy also addresses explicitly energy measurements and the required number of circuits to perform them. Our simulated circuits approach the benchmark results exponentially with a polynomial scaling in quantum resources for each nucleus and configuration space. Our work paves the way for quantum computing shell-model studies across the nuclear chart.},

          , 
            We present a review of the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz and related ansätze which are used to variationally solve the electronic structure problem on quantum computers. A brief history of coupled cluster (CC) methods is provided, followed by a broad discussion of the formulation of CC theory. This includes touching on the merits and difficulties of the method and several variants, UCC among them, in the classical context, to motivate their applications on quantum computers. In the core of the text, the UCC ansatz and its implementation on a quantum computer are discussed at length, in addition to a discussion on several derived and related ansätze specific to quantum computing. The review concludes with a unified perspective on the discussed ansätze, attempting to bring them under a common framework, as well as with a reflection upon open problems within the field.},

As the helium hydride ion has been proven to be widespread in the Universe, it has once again ignited interest in this substance. To understand its composition, such as getting the ground state energy and chemical bonds length of the helium hydride ion, one needs to solve the Schrödinger equation based on quantum mechanics and the variational method. However, such methods are not intuitive for non-related ﬁeld researchers. In this paper, Bohr’s semi-classical quantum model is ﬁrst used to explain the formation of the bonds’ length, and to calculate the ground state energy of hydrogen molecules. Then, such methods are extended to the helium hydride ion. Our model gives a comparably accurate result compared with the results from variational methods. Furthermore, the physical picture of this method is straightforward, and is suitable for intuitively explaining the formation of hydrogen molecules and helium hydride ions.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is expected to play an important role in solving the problem of huge computational costs in various applications by utilizing the collective properties of quantum states, including superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform computations. Quantum mechanical (QM) methods are candidates for various applications and can provide accurate absolute energy calculations in structure-based methods. QM methods are powerful tools for describing reaction pathways and their potential energy surfaces (PES). In this study, we applied quantum computing to describe the PES of the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction between chloromethane and chloride ions. We performed noiseless and noise simulations using quantum algorithms and compared the accuracy and noise effects of the ansatzes. In noiseless simulations, the results from UCCSD and k-UpCCGSD are similar to those of full configurational interaction (FCI) with the same active space, which indicates that quantum algorithms can describe the PES of the SN2 reaction. In noise simulations, UCCSD is more susceptible to quantum noise than k-UpCCGSD. Therefore, k-UpCCGSD can serve as an alternative to UCCSD to reduce quantum noisy effects in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, and k-UpCCGSD is sufficient to describe the PES of the SN2 reaction in this work. The results showed the applicability of quantum computing to the SN2 reaction pathway and provided valuable information for structure-based molecular simulations with quantum computing.},

In this paper, the performances of various unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansätze applied to VQE calculations on excited states are investigated using quantum circuits designed to represent single reference and multireference wavefunctions to calculate energy curves with respect to variations in the molecular geometry. These ansätze include standard Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD), as well as modified versions of Unitary Coupled Cluster Generalized Singles and Doubles (UCCGSD) and k-UpCCGSD, which are engineered to tackle excited states without undesired spin symmetry crossover to lower states during VQE optimization. These studies are carried out on a range of systems, including H2, H3, H4, NH, OH+, CH2, and , covering examples of spin singlet, doublet, and triplet molecular ground states with single and multireference excited states. In most cases, our calculations are in excellent agreement with results from full-configuration interaction calculations on classical machines, thus showing that the VQE algorithm is capable of calculating the lowest excited state at a certain symmetry, including multireference closed- and open-shell states, by setting appropriate restrictions on the excitations considered in the cluster operator and appropriate constraints in the qubit register encoding the starting mean field state.},

Our algorithm is deterministic and works for both real and complex roots of the Bethe equations. We illustrate our method on the spin-\${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\$ XX and XXZ models. We show that using this approach one can efficiently prepare eigenstates of the XX model on a quantum computer with quantum resources that match previous state-of-the-art approaches. We run small-scale error-mitigated implementations on the IBM quantum computers, including the preparation of the ground state for the XX and XXZ models on \$4\$ sites. Finally, we derive a new form of the Yang-Baxter equation using unitary matrices, and also verify it on a quantum computer.},

We compare its performance in both eﬃciency of implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing the full generalized single and double excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the standard ansatz employing only single and double excitations (UCCSD). k-UpCCGSD is found to show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit depth of 6(kN), compared with 6(N3) for UCCGSD, and 6((N − η)2η) for UCCSD, where N is the number of spin orbitals and η is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of these three ansaẗ ze by making classical benchmark calculations on the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state of H4 (STO-3G, 6-31G), H2O (STO-3G), and N2 (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled cluster methods. The results for ground states show that k-UpCCGSD oﬀers a good trade-oﬀ between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. UCCGSD is also found to be more accurate than UCCSD but at a greater cost for implementation. Excited states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies than for the corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a specialized multideterminantal reference state constructed from classical linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics to be improved.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

	abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE), first developed by Peruzzo et al. (2014), has received significant attention from the research community in recent years. It uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits facing exact modeling of the exponentially growing electronic wavefunction for these many-electron systems. The VQE may be used to model these complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. One important advantage is that variational algorithms have been shown to present some degree of resilience to the noise in the quantum hardware. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm, but without clear descriptions of how the diverse parts fit together. The potential practical advantages of the algorithm are also widely discussed in the literature, but with varying conclusions. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims at disentangling the relevant literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm, and to discuss future areas of research that are fundamental for the VQE to deliver on its promises. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail. These include the representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process to find ground state energies, the post processing mitigation of quantum errors, and suggested best practices. We identify four main areas of future research: (1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions required; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers; (3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process for large systems, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated in a tractable manner. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.},

This variation is such that when the procedure is applied to a quadratic form, it causes conjugate directions to be chosen, so the ultimate rate of convergence is fast when the method is used to minimize a general function. A further variation completes the method, and its ensures that the convergence rate from a bad approximation to a minimum is always efficient. Practical applications of the procedure have proved to be very satisfactory, and numerical examples are given in which functions of up to twenty variables are minimized.},

This second edition begins with a new section suitable for an introductory course on quantum phase transitions, assuming no prior knowledge of quantum field theory. It also contains several new chapters to cover important recent advances, such as the Fermi gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and solvable models obtained from string theory. After introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a detailed description of the canonical quantum-critical phase diagram at non-zero temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex models are explored. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics and particle and string theory"--},

abstract="Quantum Computing leverages the laws of quantum mechanics to build computers endowed with tremendous computing power. The field is attracting ever-increasing attention from both academic and private sectors, as testified by the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy in practice. However, the intrinsic restriction to linear operations significantly limits the range of relevant use cases for the application of Quantum Computing. In this work, we introduce a novel variational algorithm for quantum Single Layer Perceptron. Thanks to the universal approximation theorem, and given that the number of hidden neurons scales exponentially with the number of qubits, our framework opens to the possibility of approximating any function on quantum computers. Thus, the proposed approach produces a model with substantial descriptive power, and widens the horizon of potential applications already in the NISQ era, especially the ones related to Quantum Artificial Intelligence. In particular, we design a quantum circuit to perform linear combinations in superposition and discuss adaptations to classification and regression tasks. After this theoretical investigation, we also provide practical implementations using various simulation environments. Finally, we test the proposed algorithm on synthetic data exploiting both simulators and real quantum devices.",
